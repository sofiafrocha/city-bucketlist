# City Bucketlist

The classic starter To-Do App meets a weather API.   
Built with React and the [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/).

## Setup and install
Add a `.env` file with an Open Weather API key, like so:
```
OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

And run the install command, which will build all the assets after it's done:
```
$ npm install
```

To run in development mode:
```
$ npm run dev
```
